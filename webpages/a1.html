    <h1>Catherine Nguyen </h1>
         <p>I've loved <strong>digimon and playing board games</strong>
            since I was a child. Recently I've been trying to 
            relive those childhood memories by picking up those hobbies.
            Coincidentally, board games and digimon have evolved over 
            the years.</p>
         
        <h3>Board Games</h3>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>Over the course of two years, I have managed to collect and play many board games.</li>
                <li><strong>Here is a link to my <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/CatTastic23"
                     title="CatTastic BGG">BoardGameGeek</a> account.</strong> I use it to keep track 
                    of my collection, track number of plays, and it connects me with other board game enthusiast. 
                </li></ul>

        <h3>Digimon</h3>
            <ul type"disc>
                <li>I've sworn off mobile games for many years, but I have finally caved for this game
                    called <strong>Digimon Rearise</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>It's not the best game, but I do like Digimon. I've been playing for a month.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>Below is a picture of my family playing a game called <strong>Awkward Guest.</strong>
                 We play as detectives racing each other to become the first to deduce the murderer.
